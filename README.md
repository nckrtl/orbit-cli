# Orbit CLI

The small Laravel Zero client for the Orbit gateway. Fleet commands call the
gateway over HTTPS through `nckrtl/orbit-php-sdk`. The CLI never connects to
managed nodes through SSH.

## Development

Clone this repository beside `orbit-php-sdk`, then install dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

Composer symlinks `../php-sdk`, so local SDK changes are available at once.

## First Use

Register the gateway, trust its root CA locally, then verify the connection:

```bash
./orbit gateway:add local https://gateway.orbit --use
./orbit gateway:trust
./orbit gateway:status
```

Gateway profiles are stored in `$HOME/.orbit/config.json`. Set `ORBIT_HOME` to
override that directory. `gateway:trust` is a visible local operating-system trust step.
It can ask for local administrator privileges.

## JavaScript processes

```bash
./orbit process:add vite \
    --instance=12 \
    --runtime=systemd \
    --command=/usr/local/bin/vp \
    --command=run \
    --command=dev \
    --command=--host=0.0.0.0 \
    --working-directory=/home/orbit/apps/acme \
    --restart=always \
    --start
```

Use `vp install` for project dependencies and `vp run <script>` for package
scripts. Vite+ follows its native package-manager selection order and
defaults projects without a manager signal to pnpm. Bun is used only when
project state selects it. Orbit installs pnpm by default.
Orbit installs Bun separately from the Vite+-managed Node runtime. PHP
dependencies continue to use Composer.

## Quality

```bash
composer test       # Pest 5 with local TIA
composer test:full  # full Pest suite
composer format     # Mago formatter
composer check      # TIA tests and all Mago checks
```
